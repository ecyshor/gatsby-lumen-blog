\    Imagine you're in your kitchen. And you open the drawer marked spoons, but you find no spoons there. You do find however the wireless light switch that you thought you lost a few months back, and now you understand why every time someone opened the cabinet under the spoons drawer, the light would switch on as opening the cabinet would put some pressure on the drawer and the button from the light switch would be activated. You now realize that all the money that you spent on priests to cleanse your house from demons who like to haunt your lights were actually a complete waste. 

It does not sound like a pleasurable experience, does it? 

We are constantly building ourselves into the haunted kitchen.
